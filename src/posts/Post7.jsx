        <p>
            I can't believe I forgot about this place. I built it so well and it works so wonderfully (except for the searchbar that I know I can fix but I'm too lazy to do so.)
        </p>

        <p>Last time I wrote here, i was about to start my second internship as a frontend developer, look at me now. How far I've gone. I'm truly grateful for everything that has happened. I can't begin to explain how far I've come and how much I've learned in the past six months.</p>
        
        <p>Where do I begin?</p>

        <p>I'm swamped with work from every side. I barely have enough time to think about anything aside from it. Currently I'm in the final process of delivering a huge project that I'm the sole responsible individual over the entire Frontend department. I'm doing my best and i'm supposed to deliver my work after tomorrow. I'm sure I will make it by then but I'm worried that my work isn't to my standards, but it's alright. The goal is to fix the broken parts, and that's what I did.</p>

        <p>
            As for WonderWay, It's rough these days with the financials but I'm doing my best to keep it afloat. I think we have a chance to make something great by the end of the year if we keep our focus and not stray from the path that we set at the start of the year, today I tallied that we've made over 10 websites in the last six months, and created a whole new solution to creating bulk websites, as well as a testing frame and a bunch of new relationships that allow us to branch out and make more friends in that industrial circle.
        </p>

        <p>
            Relationship wise, since the aftershock of my breakup with K at the start of the year, it took about four months to get my shit together. I tried to move on with someone else but it ended up being the most horrible experience I've ever had with a girl in my life. I'm so glad it ended and I'm currently just hanging with Esme lately texting randomly at work, but other than that, for the last 2 months, I have not had a single moment to myself where I can reflect on the idea of being with someone else, and I'm a lot more aware of myself at the moment.

            I understand now why she ended it, and as much as it has hurt me. I respect the headshot. I wish I had done things a little differently but I think whatever happened was for the best. I hope she's happy, I'm certainly holding my brain from thinking anymore about that with the amount of work I'm subjecting to myself, but these past couple of days I've been thinking about it, and that's what led me here.
        </p>

        <p>I don't use my notebook to save my diaries anymore. This is much better, more sustainable and much more comfortable to write on.</p>

        <p>You could say we lost friends. You could say we grew others. I try not to dwell on such things.</p>

        <p>I have two websites to edit, oen website to complete, one project to finish and one HUMONGOUS project to prepare for that's worrying me. It's my first time touching flutter and I'm very risk averse with these sorts of things.</p>

        <p>OH...</p>

        <p>I'M JOINGING TWO GAME JAMS THIS YEAR !!!!</p>

        <p>First one is by pirate software and the second one is by GMTK. I feel like I need a hobby outside of work and I think those two gamejams are the perfect opportunity for me to let go of css work a little and have fun working with Blender, Godot and any other opensource tool to make something fun.</p>

        <p>I can't wait to lay down in the summer sand and watch Double Fine Adventure under an umbrella with food and cold water splashing by my feet. I miss that feeling.</p>

        <p>I've been watching <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIhLvue17Sd70y34zh2erWWpMyOnh4UN_">Double Fine  PsychOdyssey</a> and it's been giving me fantasies of running my own studio someday for something. I don't what it is exactly, but I want to do it; Have creative control to do whatever I want. I'm pretty sure it'll suck financially, but i'm okay with that... I think</p>

        <p>I can't tell you how I'll be from here on out. It's a messy life out there and it's gonna get messier with time. I can only expect the worse and hope for the best.</p>

        <p>Hope for the best...</p>

        <p>I'll try to write more thoughts on here, it's really fun to do so, and I'm tired of filling my Google Keep with random long notes.</p>

        <p>Which reminds me, My book "The Kimberly Complex" is on hold. I'm not sad anymore in that regard and it was more of a healing tool than a book. I just needed someone else to feel what I was going through I supposed. I owe her a good ending, she helped me tremendously.</p>

        <p>To Simon: Thanks for everything, I owe you.</p>

        <p>See you in the next episode.</p>
